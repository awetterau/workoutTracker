#State the final inspiration statement that you crafted for your chosen audience
Have you ever been exercising and decided that you want to start tracking your progress? After looking through the options of apps they are all very poor, they make you enter the same information again and again, they have glitches and crash, and worst of all they have ads. We wanted to develop an app that adressed these issues and make it as easy and convienent as possible for our users to improve.
#State the possible solutions from preliminary ideation that you considered

#State the final app idea that your team has decided to do
