## 1. Which audiences did you consider, and which one did you settle on for your app?
Gamers are a group that needs a new way to track and stay involved with their game at all times because they value their performance.

People who exercise are a community who need a way to progress because they value self-improvement. 
We settled on the people who exercise.
